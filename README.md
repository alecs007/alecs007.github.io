<i><strong><h1 align=center> My first portfolio </h1></strong></i>

This is my first portfolio project, created to showcase my skills and projects as a beginner developer. It was built using Vite, which provided a fast and efficient setup for development. This project helped me gain valuable experience with React and explore new techniques in web development.

While building this portfolio, I:

	•  Learned how to create reusable components in React, making the code more organized.
	•  Developed my CSS skills to design a responsive layout that works well on different devices.
	•  Focused on creating a clean, user-friendly interface to ensure a smooth browsing experience.
