 <i><strong><h1 align=center> My first portfolio </h1></strong></i>

This is my first portfolio project, created to showcase my skills and projects as a beginner developer. It was built using Vite, which provided a fast and efficient setup for development. This project helped me get better at using React and learn new techniques for building websites.

**While building this portfolio, I:**

	•  Learned how to create reusable components in React, making the code more organized.
	•  Developed my CSS skills to design a responsive layout that works well on different devices.
	•  Focused on creating a clean, user-friendly interface to ensure a smooth browsing experience.
 	•  Added Two Languages: Made the site available in both Romanian and English, learning how to switch between languages in React.
  
  This project was a great experience, and I'm looking forward to learning more and improving in the future.
