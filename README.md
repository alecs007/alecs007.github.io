<h1 align=center> My first portfolio </h1>

  This is my first portfolio project, created to showcase my skills and projects as a beginner developer. It was built using Vite, which provided a fast and efficient setup for development. This project helped me gain valuable experience with React and explore new techniques in web development.

While building this portfolio, I:

• Learned how to create reusable components in React, making the code more organized and easier to manage.
• Developed my CSS skills to design a responsive and visually appealing layout that works well on different devices.
• Focused on creating a clean, user-friendly interface to ensure a smooth browsing experience.
