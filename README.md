# <h1 align="center"><strong><em>My first portfolio</em></strong></h1>

This is my first portfolio project, created to showcase my skills and projects as a beginner developer. It was built using Vite, which provided a fast and efficient setup for development. This project helped me get better at using React and learn new techniques for building websites.

**While building this portfolio, I:**

	• Reusable Components: Learned to create reusable components in React, improving code organization.
	• Responsive Layout: Developed CSS skills to design a layout that adapts seamlessly across various devices.
	• User Interface: Focused on building a clean, intuitive interface to ensure a smooth and engaging browsing experience.
 	• Multilingual Support: Implemented language-switching functionality, making the site available in both Romanian and English.
  
  This project was a great experience, and I'm looking forward to learning more and improving in the future.
